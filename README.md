How College Performance Predicts Draft Position and Rookie Salary

This project analyzes how NCAA men’s basketball statistics influence NBA draft position and rookie contract salary, using three draft classes:

2002

2012

2022

I created a combined dataset with college stats, draft results, advanced analytics, and NBA salary information. SQL was used for querying and modeling relationships, and Tableau was used to visualize trends across eras, positions, and conferences.
